IDEAS (AKA Scope creep)
-----------------------
- Use odds system to show who is playing it safe and who is gambling?
- You could use the above info to indicate a 'favourite' early-on

- How is your game going compared to others. Leaderboard of games with potential prizes? Walking the gambling fine line maybe?
